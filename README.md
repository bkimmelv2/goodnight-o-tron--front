# Goodnight-o-Tron
## An app for all of your bedtime reading needs!
Do you have children who like to read bedtime stories? Are you sick of having to pick the books out yourself every single night? Well I have the solution for you! The Goodnight-o-Tron is a simple app to make bedtime reading a breeze. Simply load in the collection of books you have at home and hit GENERATE on the home page. This will select two books at random for you to read to your little one. After reading time is over, you have the option to leave a brief note about that specific reading experience. This will also record the date you read the book as well as an attention score from 1-5 that you can use to gauge how interested your child was at that moment. Once a note is submitted, it can be viewed on the All Notes screen. Opening an individual Book entry in your Library will also show all notes associated with that book.

Save some memories and make bedtime easy with the Goodnight-o-Tron!

## Unsolved Problems & Future Additions
- When a book name is edited, the notes associated with it will not adjust their names and as a result will not appear on that book's show page. This is being worked on.
- When a book is deleted, all associated notes remain in the list of all notes. In the future, all associated notes will be deleted.
- User login feature to be added in later version. Will track each user's book libraries individually.
